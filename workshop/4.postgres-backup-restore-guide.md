# PostgreSQL Backup and Restore Guide for Distributed Environments

This guide covers backup and restore strategies for a distributed PostgreSQL setup, focusing on tools and commands suitable for a multi-tenant chat application.

## I. Backup Tools and Strategies

### 1. pg_dump and pg_dumpall

- **Purpose**: Logical backups of databases or entire clusters
- **Pros**: Flexible, can backup specific tables/schemas
- **Cons**: Can be slow for very large databases

### 2. pg_basebackup

- **Purpose**: Physical backup of the entire PostgreSQL cluster
- **Pros**: Fast, suitable for large databases
- **Cons**: Must backup entire cluster, requires consistent state

### 3. Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

- **Purpose**: Continuous backup allowing restoration to any point in time
- **Pros**: Minimal data loss, flexible recovery options
- **Cons**: More complex setup, requires additional storage

### 4. Third-party Tools

- Examples: Barman, pgBackRest
- **Pros**: Additional features, often easier to manage
- **Cons**: May require additional learning and setup

## II. Example Backup Commands

### 1. Using pg_dump

```bash
# Backup a single database
pg_dump -h localhost -U username -d dbname -F c -f /path/to/backup/dbname.backup

# Backup specific tables
pg_dump -h localhost -U username -d dbname -t table1 -t table2 -F c -f /path/to/backup/tables_backup.backup

# Backup all databases
pg_dumpall -h localhost -U username -f /path/to/backup/all_databases.sql
```

### 2. Using pg_basebackup

```bash
# Full cluster backup
pg_basebackup -h localhost -U replication_user -D /path/to/backup/directory -Ft -z -P

# With WAL archiving
pg_basebackup -h localhost -U replication_user -D /path/to/backup/directory -Ft -z -P -X stream
```

### 3. Setting up Continuous Archiving

In postgresql.conf:
```
wal_level = replica
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'test ! -f /path/to/archive/%f && cp %p /path/to/archive/%f'
```

### 4. Using Barman (example setup)

```bash
# Install Barman
sudo apt-get install barman

# Configure Barman (in barman.conf)
[servername]
description =  "Our PostgreSQL Server"
conninfo = host=localhost user=barman dbname=postgres
backup_method = rsync
archiver = on

# Perform a backup
barman backup servername

# List backups
barman list-backup servername
```

## III. Restore Commands and Procedures

### 1. Restoring from pg_dump

```bash
# Restore a database
pg_restore -h localhost -U username -d dbname /path/to/backup/dbname.backup

# Restore specific tables
pg_restore -h localhost -U username -d dbname -t table1 -t table2 /path/to/backup/tables_backup.backup

# Restore all databases
psql -h localhost -U username -f /path/to/backup/all_databases.sql
```

### 2. Restoring from pg_basebackup

```bash
# Stop PostgreSQL
sudo systemctl stop postgresql

# Clear the data directory
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*

# Restore the base backup
sudo tar xzf /path/to/backup/base.tar.gz -C /var/lib/postgresql/data

# Create recovery.conf (for PostgreSQL < 12)
echo "restore_command = 'cp /path/to/archive/%f %p'" > /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf

# For PostgreSQL 12+, use recovery.signal
touch /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.signal

# Start PostgreSQL
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### 3. Point-in-Time Recovery

```bash
# In postgresql.conf
restore_command = 'cp /path/to/archive/%f %p'
recovery_target_time = '2023-07-15 15:30:00'

# Create recovery.signal file
touch /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.signal

# Start PostgreSQL
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### 4. Restoring with Barman

```bash
# List available backups
barman list-backup servername

# Restore a specific backup
barman recover --target-time "2023-07-15 15:30:00" --remote-ssh-command "ssh postgres@dbhost" servername 20230715T153000 /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## IV. Best Practices for Distributed Environments

1. **Consistent Backups**: Ensure all servers are backed up at consistent points to maintain data integrity across the cluster.

2. **Backup Verification**: Regularly test your backups by performing restore operations to a separate environment.

3. **Backup Rotation**: Implement a backup rotation strategy to balance between retention and storage costs.

4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for your backup processes to ensure they complete successfully.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your backup and restore procedures, including any server-specific steps.

6. **Security**: Secure your backups with encryption and access controls.

7. **Network Considerations**: In distributed setups, be mindful of network bandwidth when performing backups. Consider using compression and incremental backups.

8. **Automated Scripts**: Develop scripts to automate and schedule your backup procedures across all servers.

Example backup script for multiple servers:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

SERVERS=("server1" "server2" "server3")
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backups"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

for SERVER in "${SERVERS[@]}"
do
    echo "Backing up $SERVER"
    pg_dump -h $SERVER -U username -d dbname -F c -f $BACKUP_DIR/${SERVER}_${DATE}.backup
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Backup of $SERVER completed successfully"
    else
        echo "Backup of $SERVER failed" >&2
    fi
done
```

Remember to adapt these commands and practices to your specific setup, considering factors like your partitioning scheme, replication strategy, and specific multi-tenant architecture.
