## II. SQL Commands for Metric Collection

### 1. Database Size and Growth

```sql
-- Total database size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));

-- Size of specific tables (adjust table names as needed)
SELECT relname AS table_name, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid)) AS total_size,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(relid)) AS table_size,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid) - pg_relation_size(relid)) AS index_size
FROM pg_catalog.pg_statio_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;

-- Table growth over time (requires pg_stat_statements extension)
SELECT relname AS table_name,
       n_tup_ins AS inserts,
       n_tup_upd AS updates,
       n_tup_del AS deletes,
       n_live_tup AS live_tuples,
       n_dead_tup AS dead_tuples
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_live_tup DESC;
```

### 2. Query Performance

```sql
-- Slowest queries (requires pg_stat_statements extension)
SELECT query, 
       calls, 
       total_time / 1000 AS total_seconds, 
       mean_time / 1000 AS mean_seconds,
       rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT schemaname, relname, indexrelname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### 3. Tenant and User Metrics

```sql
-- Number of tenants
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tenants;

-- Number of users per tenant
SELECT tenant_id, COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM users
GROUP BY tenant_id
ORDER BY user_count DESC;

-- Message count per tenant
SELECT tenant_id, COUNT(*) AS message_count
FROM messages
GROUP BY tenant_id
ORDER BY message_count DESC;
```

### 4. Partition Usage

```sql
-- Rows per partition
SELECT tableoid::regclass AS partition_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM messages
GROUP BY tableoid
ORDER BY row_count DESC;

-- Size of each partition
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(partitiontablename::regclass)) AS partition_size,
       partitiontablename
FROM pg_partitions
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(partitiontablename::regclass) DESC;
```

### 5. Server Resource Utilization

```sql
-- Active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

-- Transaction ID wraparound status
SELECT datname, age(datfrozenxid) AS xid_age
FROM pg_database
ORDER BY xid_age DESC;

-- Cache hit ratio
SELECT 
    sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
    sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio
FROM 
    pg_statio_user_tables;
```

### 6. Replication Lag (if using streaming replication)

```sql
-- On primary server
SELECT client_addr, state, sent_lsn, write_lsn, flush_lsn, replay_lsn
FROM pg_stat_replication;

-- On standby server
SELECT now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp() AS replication_lag;
```

## III. Using the Template and SQL Commands

1. Regularly collect metrics using the SQL commands provided.
2. Fill out the capacity planning template monthly or quarterly.
3. Use the gathered data to forecast growth and plan for capacity expansion.
4. Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
5. Adjust the scalability thresholds based on observed performance and growth patterns.

Remember to adapt these queries to your specific schema and partitioning strategy. Some queries may need to be run on each server in your distributed setup and the results aggregated.
