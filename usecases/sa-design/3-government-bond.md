# Title: High-Volume Government Bond Reservation System
## Background:
The government is issuing bonds worth a total of 10,000 million baht. Individuals can reserve bonds ranging from 5,000 to 50 million baht. The system expects tens of thousands of interested reservers. Successful reservations require a 10% payment within 24 hours to be confirmed.

## Key Points:

1. Total Bond Value: 10,000 million baht
2. Individual Reservation Range: 5,000 - 50 million baht
3. Expected Users: Tens of thousands
4. Payment Requirement: 10% of reserved amount within 24 hours
5. High Demand-to-Supply Ratio: Potentially oversubscribed

## Use Case Description:
Design a scalable and reliable system for managing government bond reservations, handling high concurrent user loads, enforcing reservation limits, and processing time-sensitive payments.

## Requirements:

1. High Concurrency: Handle tens of thousands of simultaneous users.
2. Scalability: Ability to scale up quickly to meet demand spikes.
3. Inventory Management: Accurately track and update bond availability in real-time.
4. Reservation Limits: Enforce minimum (5,000 baht) and maximum (50 million baht) reservation amounts per user.
5. Payment Processing: Handle initial 10% payments within 24 hours of reservation.
6. User Authentication: Secure login and possibly integration with national ID systems.
7. Fairness: Implement a system to give all eligible citizens a fair chance at reserving bonds.
8. Reporting: Generate real-time reports on reservation status and fund collection.
9. Reservation Confirmation: Automatically confirm or cancel reservations based on payment status.
10. User Experience: Provide clear feedback on reservation status and payment requirements.

## Challenges to Address:

1. Traffic Management: Handle the initial surge of users trying to reserve bonds.
2. Database Contention: Manage high read/write loads on the bond inventory.
3. Payment Integration: Seamlessly integrate with various payment systems for the 10% initial payment.
4. Reservation Expiry: Implement a system to automatically expire unpaid reservations after 24 hours.
5. Partial Allocation: Design a fair system for partial allocation if the bonds are oversubscribed.
6. Security: Ensure the system is secure against fraud and cyber attacks, given the financial nature of the transactions.
7. Compliance: Adhere to financial regulations and government policies.
8. Real-time Reporting: Provide up-to-the-minute reports for government officials.

## Discussion Points for the Workshop:

1. What architecture would be most suitable for this high-stakes, high-concurrency scenario?
2. How to implement a fair allocation system if the bonds are oversubscribed?
3. What database technology and caching strategies would be most appropriate for real-time inventory management?
4. How to design the payment system integration to handle various payment methods and high transaction volumes?
5. What strategies can be employed to prevent fraud and ensure only eligible citizens can reserve bonds?
6. How to implement the 24-hour payment window and automatic reservation expiry?
7. What kind of monitoring and alerting system should be in place for both technical issues and unusual financial activities?
8. How to design the system to be resilient to partial failures, considering the critical nature of the application?
9. What strategies can be used to manage user expectations and provide a positive experience even if they don't secure their desired bond amount?
